* Heffy
*What is this?*
This is an experiment. We are building a text editor in Haskell.

*Things we want to keep in mind and eventually implement:*
- *buffer*: efficient way to represent text with specific a data structure (e.g. rope TODO);
- allows /concurrent/ manipulation of the *buffer*;
- client/server architecture;
- *heffy-core*: is a library. The editor consists in a program that consumes the library (like XMonad). This will enable customization;

* Steps
- [ ] Bootstrap the project using nix
- [ ] Implement buffer using some datastructure and visualize it on screen
