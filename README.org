* Heffy
*What is this?*
This is an experiment. We are building a text editor in Haskell.

*Things we want to keep in mind and eventually implement:*
- *buffer*: efficient way to represent text with specific a data structure (probably a Rope);
- allows /concurrent/ manipulation of the *buffer* (async);
- client/server architecture;
- *heffy-core*: is a library. The editor consists in a program that consumes the library (like XMonad). This will enable customization;

* Steps [1/3]
** DONE Bootstrap the project using nix
** TODO Research, pick core dependencies and choose core data structures
** TODO Implement and test core datastructure
